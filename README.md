# amiga-includes

One-file versions of the (hopefully official) include files for Amiga assembly programming.

Just download the one-file `.i` of your choice from the `dist` folder and include it in your source code:

```
	INCLUDE	"includes_v34.i"
```

The `includes` folder contains the original (although slighty modified) sets of include files.
